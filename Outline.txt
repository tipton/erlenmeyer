Flask in Minute Detail

Hello, World!
	Naming things - pet peeve
	What is implicit; what must be explicit
	80% of software is about naming things and subroutines
	Names are arbitrary, but can be freighted with meaning
		- particularly when the framework assigns meaning to names
	Flask is largely about "request" and "response"
		"request" includes cookie information (i.e., session info)
	Living in an HTTP world - not just about data
Break it apart: 
	Some standards in naming
	Imports to connect things
	Circular imports in Python
Landing Page
	templates directory
	Add login page
	Add action page
	static directory
	use Python built-in library
	make useful utility functions
	difference between render_template() and redirect(url_for())
